# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:

  assets:
    - assets/images/creative.png
    - assets/images/sala.jpg
    - assets/images/banheiro.jpg
    - assets/images/quarto.jpg
    - assets/images/garagem.jpg
    - assets/images/cozinha.jpg
    - assets/images/logoPequena.png
    - assets/images/logoPequenaBranco.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  #  fonts:
  #    - family: Pacifico
  #      fonts:
  #        - asset: fonts/Pacifico-Regular.ttf
  #    - family: Roboto
  #      fonts:
  #        - asset: fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
  #    - family: OpenSansRegular
  #      fonts:
  #        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
  #    - family: OpenSansLight
  #      fonts:
  #        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Light.ttf
  #    - family: OpenSansBold
  #      fonts:
  #        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
